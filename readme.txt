I put three files to this folder which are Server side, Client side and iot. iot is a database 
holding information of the users. Server side is written with Python and client side is written 
in Android Studio. You have to run the server in Python and the client in Android Studio. For 
database, I use XAMPP application and with this app, I run Apache server and connect to MySQL 
dabatase from here. In database, you have to run SQL scripts in iot txt file. For run the code
correctly, first of all, you'll run the database, and then Python server-side, after that you
can run the our application in your Android phone.
